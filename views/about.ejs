    <h1>🤷‍♀️ What Is Typed Rants?</h1>
    <p>
      Typed Rants is your designated corner of the internet where sarcasm meets keyboard therapy.
      It's a blog for opinions that didn’t ask to be helpful — just loud, typed, and slightly dramatic.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Does This Exist?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Because yelling on social media is overrated (and exhausting).</li>
      <li>To give your rants a home — a sarcastic, slightly judgmental home.</li>
      <li>To document the weird, annoying, and painfully relatable things in life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This site doesn’t promise wisdom. But it <strong>does</strong> promise honesty — and maybe a laugh or two.
      So go ahead, type that rant. We won’t judge. Much.
